> I knew I wouldn't have trouble with the basic logic of setting up the game.  The challenge was getting the "AI" to work.  I saw that another person had made a list of winning combinations and loved the idea.  Made my own implementation of the idea where every move made is inserted into the winning combination list. My AI then makes a ranked move list based on how many 'X's or 'Y's are the winning combinations and chooses a random move from that list.

> Good luck beating the "AI"
